### Description 
The increased occurrence and severity of worldwide disasters, exacerbated by the impact of climate change, pose significant challenges to emergency management, calling for novel and more effective Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) approaches. Despite the phenomenological differences of diverse hazards and the heterogeneity of local policies and governance structures, effective communication systems are needed to better manage the available resources in all phases of the emergency management cycle, especially in the case of cross-border events. In this work, we present the design, implementation, and validation of a novel tool for emergency management, i.e., the ERMES Chatbot: a mobile-based conversational communication system developed to facilitate real-time bidirectional communication between control centres, in-field forces, and citizens. The methodology used to create the ERMES Chatbot is grounded on the user-centred design approach, which entails end-user involvement in all key phases of the development, including the definition of the end-user requirements, the technical design, and the final validation of the proposed solution. The co-design approach involved several organisations belonging to the DRR domain, which includes a gamified experience for citizens and is iteratively validated through four in-field demonstration events based on realistic emergency scenarios with the involvement of emergency practitioners, volunteering organisations, and citizens.

## Integral Chatbot Solution for Efficient Incident Management and Emergency or Disaster Response: Optimizing Communication and Coordination - [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378519729_Integral_Chatbot_Solution_for_Efficient_Incident_Management_and_Emergency_or_Disaster_Response_Optimizing_Communication_and_Coordination]

### Description
Climate change, with its unstable and dynamic weather phenomena, has a significant impact on the city of Piura, Peru, making it particularly vulnerable to the El Ni√±o phenomenon. The limited technological infrastructure for communication between local authorities and the community has resulted in decisions that are unacceptable to the population. In order to address this gap and improve coordination during emergency or disaster situations, it is proposed to develop a specialized chatbot that integrates with modern platforms such as WhatsApp, Manychat, and Google Sheets. The solution was evaluated through a questionnaire and an observation guide, addressed to 30 citizens of the districts of Piura, Castilla, and Catacaos, Peru. The degree of satisfaction on the part of the users was 26.38%. In terms of the criterion of clarity, it is 26.44%. While 22.73% said that they needed coherence and fluency in conversation, Lastly, 24.45% corresponded to the level of accuracy in forwarding information and queries. The results of the study highlight the effectiveness of this solution as a digital alternative that not only optimizes incident management but also provides efficient responses and motivates citizens to be prepared through the use of modern technologies.

## A simulation evacuation framework for effective disaster preparedness strategies and response decision making - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221723006793]

### Description
This research developed a keyword-based chatbot system, Ask Diana, for water-related disaster management. Disaster management has been considered difficult and tedious due to the complex characteristics of disaster-related data. To deal with this problem, this research developed a chatbot system with a water-related disaster database, a user intent mechanism, and an intuitive mobile-device-based user interface. With such a system, users are able to access important data or information they need for decision making by directly asking the proposed chatbot or operating the image-based menus. The system was validated through a usability test and a six-month field test. The results demonstrated that Ask Diana can help related personnel access disaster data intuitively and develop corresponding response strategies efficiently.

## DisBot: A Portuguese Disaster Support Dynamic Knowledge Chatbot - [https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/24/9082]

### keywords
disaster management; community resilience; situational awareness; natural language processing; chatbots; knowledge graphs

### Description
This paper presents DisBot, the first Portuguese speaking chatbot that uses social media retrieved knowledge to support citizens and first-responders in disaster scenarios, in order to improve community resilience and decision-making. It was developed and tested using Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM), being progressively matured with field specialists through several design and development iterations. DisBot uses a state-of-the-art Dual Intent Entity Transformer (DIET) architecture to classify user intents, and makes use of several dialogue policies for managing user conversations, as well as storing relevant information to be used in further dialogue turns. To generate responses, it uses real-world safety knowledge, and infers a dynamic knowledge graph that is dynamically updated in real-time by a disaster-related knowledge extraction tool, presented in previous works. Through its development iterations, DisBot has been validated by field specialists, who have considered it to be a valuable asset in disaster management.


## Telegram-Based Chatbot Application for Foreign People in Japan to Share Disaster-Related Information in Real-Time - [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9118510]

### Description
When a disaster occurs, early evacuation of residents is one of the effective ways for the reduction of human damage. Then, the rapid collection and delivery of accurate disaster-related information are essential. In this study, we develop a chatbot application as an add-on to the Telegram platform interface. This chatbot provides emergency information to foreign people in Japan at the time of disasters. The information provided by the proposed application is, for example, the nearby evacuation points such as the evacuation centers and train stations, and the real-time disaster information based on the user's current location. People can also share disaster-related pictures via the proposed application. Such pictures may be useful not only for disaster-affected people but also for governmental agencies to gain a better understanding of current conditions and thus help them make informed decisions.
