## A simulation evacuation framework for effective disaster preparedness strategies and response decision making - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221723006793

### keywords
Disaster preparednessDisaster responsePedestrian evacuation

### Description
This paper explores the use of the Stochastic Pedestrian Cell Transmission Model (SPCTM), a simulation framework for managing evacuations after major earthquakes. Developed in collaboration with Taiwan's National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR), SPCTM provides insights into evacuation dynamics, specifically focusing on the impact of evacuee compliance with government protocols, neighborhood-specific evacuation times, and shelter allocation strategies. The findings offer useful guidance for decision-makers to improve disaster preparedness and response, helping optimize evacuation plans and reduce overall evacuation times.

## Emergency Evacuation Information System Using IoT - https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-3810-6_28

### Description
This paper explores enhancing Emergency Evacuation Information Systems (EEIS) by integrating IoT technologies to improve emergency preparedness and response. The study highlights current system limitations, including delays, poor information dissemination, and inefficient resource allocation. By utilizing IoT devices like sensors and communication modules, real-time data collection and decision-making are improved. While IoT enhances system effectiveness, challenges such as cost, power consumption, and network coverage remain. Future work aims to explore cost-effective, energy-efficient IoT solutions and AI for predictive analysis to further optimize EEIS.
